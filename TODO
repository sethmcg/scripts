TODO:

Unify calc_*ncl scripts:

0) Set up test files - one each of inputs & outputs generated using
   old code to compare.  Short & small - just a few timesteps &
   gridcells, enough that dump to text isn't very big.

1) Divide code up into sections with big markers & better comments

2) Define a standard set of variables names & mapping to longname

3) Change input: user provides what's being calculated, a template
   infile, the variable in the template, and an outfile.  Optional:
   overrides for variable names if they're not standard.  Template
   file is what gets used as template for output; template filename is
   what gets used to construct all the other infile names.

4) Figure out how to get NCL to do something like
   fin <- lapply(list(tas=tfile, huss=hfile, ps=pfile), nc_ingest)

5) Change input & output to use all this stuff

6) Put all the calculation bits into a big switch statement in the
   middle.
